**1. Introduction**

This document provides a detailed guide on deploying Passbolt, an open-source password manager, on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The deployment includes setting up Passbolt on an EC2 instance, configuring HTTPS for secure communication, connecting the instance to an Ubuntu machine, and finally, cleaning up AWS resources to avoid unnecessary charges.

---

**2. Prerequisites**

Before starting the deployment process, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- An AWS Account with appropriate permissions to create EC2 instances.
- Ubuntu Installed on VMware or Virtual Box for managing the EC2 instance.
- (Optional) A domain name from a registrar like Namecheap for SSL configuration and accessibility.

---

**3. Deployment Steps**

**3.1 Setting Up Passbolt on AWS**

1. Visit the Passbolt official website and navigate to the AWS section under Getting Started.
2. Access AWS Marketplace and choose a region that is geographically close to your location.
3. Subscribe to Passbolt (the software is free, but there may be infrastructure costs).
4. Configure the instance settings and launch a new instance based on the seller's settings.
5. Create an EC2 key pair for authentication. Use `ssh-keygen` on Ubuntu to generate keys and import the public key to AWS.
6. Launch the EC2 instance and wait for it to initialize.

**3.2 Configuring HTTPS for Secure Communication**

1. Access the EC2 instance using its public IPv4 address.
2. Start the HTTPS configuration process in Passbolt. If using a domain, configure SSL accordingly (optional but recommended for security).
3. Connect the EC2 instance to your Ubuntu machine using SSH.

**3.3 Passbolt Configuration**

1. Start the Passbolt configuration from the web interface.
2. Enter the server name, email, and skip SMTB configuration (if not needed).
3. Download and install the Passbolt extension for your browser.
4. Create and manage passwords using the Passbolt extension.

**4. Project Closure**

To avoid unnecessary charges, it's crucial to clean up AWS resources after completing the project. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
3. Terminate the EC2 instance created for Passbolt deployment.
4. Ensure all associated resources (e.g., security groups, key pairs) are also deleted or disassociated.

---

**5. Conclusion**

By following this documentation, you have successfully deployed Passbolt on AWS, configured HTTPS for secure communication, and managed the Passbolt configuration. Remember to regularly update and maintain your Passbolt instance for optimal security and performance.

---

**6. Additional Notes:**

- For detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips, refer to the official Passbolt documentation and AWS documentation.
- Regularly back up Passbolt data to prevent data loss.
- Monitor AWS billing to avoid unexpected charges, especially if you have enabled additional services or resources.
