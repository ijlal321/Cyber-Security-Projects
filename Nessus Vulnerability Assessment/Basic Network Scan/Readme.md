**Cyber Security Project Documentation: Vulnerability Assessment Using Nessus**

**1. Project Overview**

This documentation outlines the process of conducting a vulnerability scan using Nessus as part of our cybersecurity project. The objective is to identify and assess vulnerabilities within a networked environment.

**2. Lab Initialization**

- Set up a lab environment with Windows installed on VMware or any other virtual machine.
- Ensure Nessus is installed and configured on a system within the lab.

**3. Scanning Process**

**Step 1: Start a New Scan**
- Launch Nessus and navigate to the right top corner to start a new scan.
  
**Step 2: Basic Network Scan**
- Choose the option for a basic network scan.
- Enter the IP address, relevant descriptions, and project name.

**4. Configuration of Discovery Options**
- Configure the discovery options, such as choosing between port scan comment boards (common ports, all boards, or custom).
- Select the assessment options (default or customized) and save the configuration.

**5. Initiating the Scan**
- After saving the configuration, click on the project and then click Start to initiate the vulnerability assessment.

**6. Scan Completion and Analysis**
- Wait for the vulnerability scan to complete.
- Once complete, review the comprehensive list of vulnerabilities identified in the system.

**7. Detailed Analysis and Reporting**
- Click on each vulnerability to view its details and severity level.
- Generate a detailed report by clicking the report button located on the right top side of the interface.

**8. Conclusion and Assessment**

After conducting the vulnerability scan using Nessus, it was determined that there were no critical, high, or medium-severity vulnerabilities detected. This indicates that the system is currently secure and free from significant security risks.

**9. Summary**

The successful completion of the vulnerability assessment demonstrates the effectiveness of our security measures and proactive approach to cybersecurity. By regularly conducting scans and addressing any identified vulnerabilities, we can maintain a secure and resilient system environment.
