# Cyber Security Project: Vulnerability Assessment

This repository contains scripts, documentation, and resources related to conducting vulnerability assessments on different systems.

## Overview

In this project, we follow a structured approach to vulnerability assessment, including the following steps:

1. **Basic Network Scan**: Utilize Nessus or similar tools to perform a basic network scan and identify potential vulnerabilities within the networked environment.

2. **Credential Scan**: Conduct a credential scan to assess the security of user credentials and identify any weaknesses or risks associated with authentication mechanisms.

3. **Advanced Nessus Scanning for Vulnerable Software**: Utilize advanced scanning techniques with Nessus to identify vulnerabilities in specific software applications or systems, focusing on potential exploitability.

4. **Remediation of Vulnerabilities from Previous Projects**: Implement remediation measures based on vulnerabilities identified in previous assessments to enhance overall security posture.

5. **Vulnerability Assessment on Metasploitable**: Perform a comprehensive vulnerability assessment on a Metasploitable system to identify potential vulnerabilities and simulate real-world attack scenarios.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Nessus or similar vulnerability scanning tools installed and configured.
- Access to systems for conducting vulnerability assessments (e.g., test environments, Metasploitable VM).

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
 [git clone](https://github.com/ijlal321/Cyber-Security-Projects/tree/main/Nessus%20Vulnerability%20Assessment)


3. Navigate to the appropriate directory for the type of vulnerability assessment you want to perform:
- `basic-network-scan`
- `credential-scan`
- `advanced-nessus-scan`
- `remediation-of-vulnerabilities`
- `metasploitable-assessment`

3. Follow the README and instructions in each directory for detailed steps on conducting the vulnerability assessment.
