# Project Documentation: Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation

## Title:
"Mitigating Risks: Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation Due to Outdated and Vulnerable Software"

### Introduction
This project focuses on conducting a vulnerability assessment on a Windows system deployed on VMware. The assessment aims to identify and remediate vulnerabilities stemming from outdated software versions, specifically Google Chrome (version 68.0.3440.84) and a Minecraft server.

### Installation of Vulnerable Software
1. **Google Chrome (Version 68.0.3440.84)**
   - Downloaded from Slimjet, this version was chosen for its known vulnerabilities.
   - The auto-update feature was disabled via Windows services to prevent automatic updates and maintain vulnerability status.

2. **Minecraft Server (2021 version)**
   - Obtained from a reputable source to ensure authenticity.
   - Installed on the Windows system within the VMware environment.

### Vulnerability Scan using Nessus
1. **Scan Configuration**
   - Utilized Nessus for the vulnerability scan due to its comprehensive coverage and detailed reporting capabilities.
   - Configured a basic network scan targeting the Windows system with credential selection settings enabled for thorough assessment.

2. **Scan Execution**
   - Executed the Nessus scan to identify vulnerabilities across the system, focusing on Google Chrome and the Minecraft server.
   - Nessus provides detailed vulnerability reports, including CVE numbers, severity levels, exploitability, and suggested remediation steps.
   - Users can search for more information about specific vulnerabilities by using the CVE numbers and conducting further research.

3. **Vulnerability Findings**
   - **Google Chrome**: Identified vulnerabilities include use-after-free in password handling, out-of-bound memory access in HID interactions, and other critical vulnerabilities with high CVSS scores.
   - **Minecraft Server**: Numerous vulnerabilities were discovered during the scan, although not discussed in detail in this documentation. These vulnerabilities may pose security risks and should be addressed promptly.

### Remediation Steps
1. **Google Chrome**
   - Updated Google Chrome to the latest stable version available to patch identified vulnerabilities.
   - Ensured that auto-updates were re-enabled after the remediation process for ongoing security maintenance.

2. **Minecraft Server**
   - Removed the outdated Minecraft Server version and installed the latest version or applied necessary patches if applicable.

3. **Post-Remediation Scan**
   - Conducted a follow-up scan using Nessus to verify the effectiveness of the remediation efforts.
   - Confirmed the absence of previously identified critical vulnerabilities related to Google Chrome and Minecraft Server.

### Conclusion
By leveraging Nessus for vulnerability assessment and following a structured remediation process, we successfully mitigated critical vulnerabilities arising from outdated software versions on the Windows system within the VMware environment. Regular vulnerability assessments and proactive patching strategies are essential for maintaining robust cybersecurity posture.
