## Credential Scan Documentation

### Introduction
In this documentation, we will cover the process of conducting a vulnerability scan using credentials on Windows machines using Nessus. This method provides deeper insights into system vulnerabilities by leveraging privileged access.

### About Nessus
Nessus is a widely used vulnerability assessment tool that helps identify security issues, misconfigurations, and potential vulnerabilities within a networked environment. It offers a comprehensive set of scanning capabilities and supports various platforms and protocols.

### Scan Type
For this vulnerability assessment, we are using a basic network scan with credential selection settings. This combination allows us to perform thorough scans while leveraging authentication credentials for enhanced visibility into system vulnerabilities.

### Credential Selection
1. Move to the credential section.
2. Select the Windows platform and provide the following credentials:
   - Admin or user password
   - Username
   - Domain name

If you are unsure about your Username or domain name, you can use the "Who am I" command on your Windows machine to retrieve this information.

### Privilege Issues
When attempting to start the scan, you may encounter a notification indicating that the account used does not have the necessary privileges. This is often due to the non-default administrator account not being added to the local administrator group automatically, resulting in insufficient access rights to system files and settings.

To address this issue, follow these steps:
1. Open services on Windows from VMware.
2. Change the Remote registry properties from manual to automatic.
3. Search for "Change User Account Control settings" and set the option to "Never Notify me." This prevents User Account Control from interrupting the scan.

### Starting the Scan
1. Once the privilege issues are resolved, start the credential scan by clicking on the "Start Scan" button.
2. Wait for the scan to complete.

### Scan Results
After completing the scan, review the results:
- A total of about 40 vulnerabilities were identified.
- Select a vulnerability for detailed analysis. For example, vulnerabilities related to the .NET framework were found, including:
   - Denial of Service (DDoS)
   - Remote Code Execution
- These high vulnerabilities can be mitigated by updating the Microsoft .NET Framework software.

### Remediation
To address identified vulnerabilities, follow these steps:
1. Update the Microsoft .NET Framework software to the latest version to mitigate DDoS and remote code execution vulnerabilities.
2. Monitor and apply security patches regularly to ensure the system remains secure.

### Advantages of Credential Scans
1. **Enhanced Visibility:** Credential scans provide a detailed view of system configurations, installed software, and user privileges, leading to more accurate vulnerability assessments.
2. **Detection of Hidden Vulnerabilities:** By accessing system files and settings with privileged credentials, Nessus can uncover vulnerabilities that may not be visible in unauthenticated scans.
3. **Improved Remediation Guidance:** With access to detailed system information, Nessus can provide targeted remediation guidance, including specific updates or configuration changes to mitigate vulnerabilities effectively.

### Disadvantages of Credential Scans
1. **Credential Management:** Managing and securely storing credentials for scanning can be challenging, requiring careful handling to prevent unauthorized access.
2. **Impact on System Performance:** Credential scans may have a higher impact on target systems compared to unauthenticated scans, potentially affecting performance during scanning operations.
3. **Potential Security Risks:** Storing and using credentials for scanning introduces security risks, such as credential theft or misuse if not managed properly.

### Conclusion
By conducting the credential scan, we uncovered more vulnerabilities and gained deeper insights into our system compared to a basic network scan. Some vulnerabilities were identified as high and critical, emphasizing the importance of using credentials in vulnerability assessments.

This documentation provides insights into the technical aspects of credential scans using Nessus and highlights their importance in comprehensive vulnerability assessments.
