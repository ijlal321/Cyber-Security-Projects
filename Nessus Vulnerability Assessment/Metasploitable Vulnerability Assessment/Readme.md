# Project Title: Nessus Network Basic Scan on Metasploitable

## Introduction

This project focuses on conducting a vulnerability assessment using Nessus Network Basic Scan on a virtual machine running Metasploitable within a VMware environment. The goal is to identify and analyze vulnerabilities present in Metasploitable for educational and testing purposes.

## Overview of Metasploitable

Metasploitable is a purposely vulnerable virtual machine designed for security testing and penetration testing practice. It contains numerous vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that allow users to simulate real-world security scenarios and test their skills in vulnerability assessment and exploitation.

## Project Setup

1. **Environment**: VMware virtual machine running Metasploitable.
2. **Tool Used**: Nessus Professional for vulnerability scanning.
3. **Scan Type**: Nessus Network Basic Scan.
4. **Target**: IP address of the Metasploitable virtual machine.

## Steps

1. **Preparation**:
   - Ensure the Metasploitable virtual machine is up and running in your VMware environment.
   - Obtain the IP address of the Metasploitable machine using the `ifconfig` command.

2. **Configuration**:
   - Launch Nessus Professional and create a new scan.
   - Select "Basic Network Scan" as the scan type.
   - Enter a descriptive name and description for the scan.
   - Input the IP address of the Metasploitable machine as the scan target.

3. **Scan Execution**:
   - Save the scan configuration and start the scan.
   - Monitor the scan progress and wait for it to complete.

4. **Results Analysis**:
   - Once the scan is finished, review the scan results in Nessus.
   - Identify and document the vulnerabilities detected in Metasploitable.

## Report Generation

After completing the scan and analyzing the results, follow these steps to generate a comprehensive report:

1. **Navigate to Reports**:
   - In the Nessus Professional interface, click on the "Reports" tab located at the top-right corner.

2. **Generate Report**:
   - Click on the "Generate Report" button to initiate the report generation process.

3. **Report Customization**:
   - Choose the desired report template and customize report settings as needed (e.g., format, sections to include).

4. **Save and Export**:
   - Once the report is generated, review it for accuracy and completeness.
   - Save the report locally or export it in various formats such as PDF, HTML, or CSV for sharing and documentation purposes.

## Conclusion

The Nessus Network Basic Scan on Metasploitable project provides valuable insights into the vulnerabilities present in a purposely vulnerable system. This project serves as a learning opportunity to understand and address common security weaknesses in virtual environments.
